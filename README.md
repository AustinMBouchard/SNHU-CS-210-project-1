# SNHU-CS-210-project-1


## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was centered around creating a modifiable clock that that displays both 12 & 24 hour time formats.
The application allows the user to increment the clock in 1 second, 1 minute, and 1 hour intervals.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think that my error handling was well executed. It is very robust.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could include using namespace std in my timeFunctions.hpp file to increase readability.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The hardest part of this project for me was learning how to join different files together in c++. I learned how to add a header file and define the methods that need to
be called into main. I used different resources online as well as advice from friends who work in the industry.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Learning how to string together multiple files in c++ was the most useful lesson I learned form this project. 

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I updated each function to include documenation, included in-line comments where needed, and added robust error handling.
